## Project Goals:

- This project is an inventory management application aimed at small businesses or individuals who need to keep track of equipment. The app required a login screen that stores user’s usernames and passwords in a database, a grid to display inventory information pulled from a database with functions to add, delete, and edit inventory, and lastly a button to prompt users to allow notifications for low quantity. 

## Screens:

- Firstly, there is a login screen that prompts a user for a username and password. If the user is not registered then the user is prompted for a pin. The pin is not a requirement of the app, but I included it as a secondary way to login to the app if users do not have their password. Next the user is taken to the inventory screen that includes clearly labeled buttons for adding items, deleting items, and enabling notifications. Users can tap on information in the table to edit it. If users tap the add item button they are taken to a new screen that prompts for item information. If users tap the button for notifications they are prompted to either accept or decline notifications. 

## Development techniques, Testing, and innovation:

- When developing this app I initially designed screens for each requirement needed then started coding based on the flow of the application. As I worked proceeded I would test the application using the built in emulator. Some things throughout development changed, such as the notification screen becoming a dialog prompt instead and placement I adjusted some button placement within the inventory screen as well. I believe the usages of the warehouse database were where I was most successful. It took a lot of work to get the functions to work properly and the grid to display, but I’m happy with the way it turned out.
